This is Module 5. 

The first step of the assignment was to wrap all the javascript and jquery in code so that the rest of the elements can load regardless of when the 
jquery code runs. This is because the code is asynchronous now. 

//https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_syntax.asp#:~:text=The%20Document%20Ready%20Event&text=This%20is%20to%20prevent%20any,ready%20before%20working%20with%20it.

Then, Instead of writing out each HTML element for the time block I instead used the parent container and one instance of the textarea to be created each time the for loop is run.

Lastly, the code needed to be stored within local storage so I ran jquery code to run a function on click event of the save button. within this two variables were created to get the text items and the timeBlock. Lastly, I set it to local storage in the DOM as instructed.
